# discordMessagespoiling
A joke script that applies a spoiler tag on every single character in a message to be sent on discord.

Please do not use this to annoy people too much. It was written just for fun.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
Run python 3.x

A message will pop up asking you for the message, which you will input and the final item will be spat out as a printed output.

You can also alter the script to create the output message in a separate file if you cat the output into a file.txt.

Last, if you want to run the program without the message prompt and as a sys arg, this can be done by importing the os modile with sys.arg set to 1 and then passing the sentence as a quoted string.
